2nd portfolio project: HTML &amp; CSS landing page

This is an Odin-Project project from their curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page.

The requirement for this project include creating a landing page based on a provided template using HTML and CSS.

~~This will be a work in progress beyond the requirements of The Odin Project and my hopes are to someday use it as a true webpage for both my professional and personal use.~~ (Edit: see live preview).

All of the pixel art included in this webpage and files are created by me, Rosemary Pineau. Please respect the work I put into them and don't copy/paste/use without at least asking.

Thanks and enjoy! I hope this puts a smile on your face!
